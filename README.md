# Custom Bootstrap - Dart SASS
This is a template project for creating a custom Bootstrap theme. It is designed to be used with the *Dart* SASS compiler.

As per [SASS's installation guide](https://sass-lang.com/install/), you will need to download the latest Dart executable from GitHub and add it to your system PATH.
Run `sass --version` in a terminal to ensure the installation succeeded.

Basic compiler command syntax is contained in `runcompiler.bat`. For more details on the Dart CLI syntax, see [the official documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/).
